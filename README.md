In a File Upload Microservice, you would typically have high-level endpoints to handle various aspects of file uploading, validation, and management. Here are some of the key endpoints you might consider:

1. **File Upload Endpoint** (`POST /pdf/upload`):

   - This endpoint allows users to upload CSV files to your application. It should accept multipart/form-data requests.
   - It receives the uploaded file, validates it (e.g., checking file type, size, and other constraints), and stores it in a temporary location.

2. **File Validation Endpoint** (`GET /validate/{file_id}`):

   - After a file is uploaded, users might want to check whether it meets certain criteria or contains errors.
   - This endpoint allows users to request a validation report for a specific file by providing its unique identifier (`file_id`).
   - The microservice validates the file and returns a report, indicating any issues found.

3. **File Metadata Retrieval Endpoint** (`GET /metadata/{file_id}`):

   - Users may need to retrieve metadata about an uploaded file, such as its name, size, upload date, or other relevant information.
   - This endpoint retrieves and returns metadata for a specific file based on its `file_id`.

4. **File Deletion Endpoint** (`DELETE /delete/{file_id}`):

   - Users may want to delete an uploaded file for various reasons.
   - This endpoint allows users to delete a file by specifying its `file_id`.

5. **List Uploaded Files Endpoint** (`GET /files`):

   - Users might need to view a list of all the files they have uploaded.
   - This endpoint returns a list of uploaded files along with their metadata.

6. **File Download Endpoint** (`GET /download/{file_id}`):
   - Users may want to download a previously uploaded file.
   - This endpoint allows users to download a specific file by providing its `file_id`.

These endpoints provide essential functionality for handling file uploads and interactions with uploaded files. You can customize the endpoints and their functionality based on your specific requirements and the level of detail you want to provide to your users.

Additionally, you should consider implementing appropriate security measures, such as access controls and authentication, to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the file upload microservice and their uploaded files.

Storing the PDF documents in an external storage service like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage while maintaining references to the documents in a relational database (RDBMS) is a practical approach, especially when dealing with large files or a high volume of documents. Here's how you can implement this approach:

**Database Schema:**

1. **User Table (Optional):**

   - You can have a table to manage user information if your application involves multiple users.

2. **Document Metadata Table:**
   - Create a table to store metadata about the uploaded documents. This table should include information such as document title, description, upload date, user ID (if applicable), and a unique document ID.
   - Include a column to store the reference to the external storage location, such as the URL or file path in S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

**External Storage Service (e.g., Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage):**

- Use the external storage service to store the actual PDF files. Each PDF should have a unique identifier, such as a filename or GUID, which corresponds to the reference stored in the database.

**Workflow:**

1. **Document Upload:**

   - When a user uploads a PDF document, store the file in the external storage service and obtain a unique identifier (e.g., the file's URL or path).
   - Insert a record into the Document Metadata table in the database, including the unique document ID and the reference to the external storage location.

2. **Document Retrieval:**

   - When a user requests to view or download a document, retrieve the metadata from the database, including the external storage reference.
   - Use the reference to access the PDF file in the external storage service and provide it to the user.

3. **Managing Documents:**
   - Implement functionality to allow users to manage their documents, such as updating document metadata, deleting documents, or organizing documents into folders or categories.
   - Ensure that changes in metadata are synchronized with the database.

**Benefits:**

- Scalability: This approach is highly scalable as external storage services are designed for handling large volumes of data efficiently.

- Performance: Storing large files externally can improve database performance and reduce backup/restore times.

- Cost-Effective: You can optimize costs by using external storage, which often offers cost-effective storage solutions.

- Data Integrity: Storing metadata in the database ensures data integrity and consistency.

**Considerations:**

- Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to secure both the database and external storage.

- Implement error handling and monitoring to ensure data consistency and address any synchronization issues between the database and external storage.

- Consider backup and disaster recovery strategies for both the database and external storage.

- Monitor the performance and costs associated with the external storage service, especially if you have a large and growing number of documents.

By using this approach, you can efficiently manage and serve PDF documents while maintaining the benefits of an RDBMS for storing metadata and maintaining data consistency.
